      <h2>Introduction</h2>

        We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy
        outlines how we handle your data when you use our service.

      <h2>Data We Do Not Collect</h2>
      <p>
        Our application does not collect or store any personally identifiable
        information (PII) from users. Additionally, we do not save the text
        input you provide during the use of our services.

      <h2>How We Process and Store Data</h2>
      <p>
        When you use our text-to-speech (TTS) service, the input text you
        provide is sent to our API for processing. This data is used solely to
        generate the requested audio. While we do not store text inputs, audio
        files generated through the service are retained for functionality and
        may remain accessible for a limited time via their respective URLs.
      </p>

      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        We may use third-party services, such as cloud providers, to deliver
        audio files. These services operate independently, and we ensure they
        comply with privacy regulations.
      </p>

      <h2>Your Privacy Rights</h2>
      <p>
        Since no personal user data is stored, you do not need to request data
        access, modification, or deletion from us. Should this policy change, we
        will update this document and notify users accordingly.
